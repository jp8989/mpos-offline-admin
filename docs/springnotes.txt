<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**"
               location="/, classpath:/WEB-INF/public-resources/"
               cache-period="10000" />
Put the resources under: src/main/webapp/images/logo.png and then access them via /resources/images/logo.png.

In the war they will be then located at images/logo.png. 
So the first location (/) form mvc:resources will pick them up.

The second location (classpath:/WEB-INF/public-resources/) in mvc:resources 
(looks like you used some roo based template) can be to expose resources 
(for example js-files) form jars, if they are located in the directory WEB-INF/public-resources in the jar.
